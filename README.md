# Portfolio site

My portfolio site contains information about me, my skills, and the projects I have made. There are also links in the footer to download my CV or visit my LinkedIn. It is a mobile-first static site made using HTML5 and responsive CSS with help from a fantastic FreeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs&t=380s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). 

## New version
A newer verison is available on my GitHub called portfoliov2 and is hosted live at: www.caolanhamilton.co.uk
